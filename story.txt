Once upon a time there was a cat that could talk to humans. His name is Onyx. This is the story of how he found out that humans could understand him.

When Onyx found out he could talk to humans he had to decide the best way to use this gift. He decided to use this to help other naimals communicate with Humans.

Onyx would travel around the world and talk to pet owners in hope to help them better understand their pet's needs. He also talked to other cats and taught them to speak English.
