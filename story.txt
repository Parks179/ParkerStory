Once upon a time there was a cat that could talk to humans. His name is Onyx. This is the story of how he found out that humans could understand him.

When Onyx found out he could talk to humans he had to decide the best way to use this gift. He decided to use this to help other naimals communicate with Humans.

Onyx would travel around the world and talk to pet owners in hope to help them better understand their pet's needs. He also talked to other cats and taught them to speak English.

With Onyx help, pets are able to communicate with their owners when they feel uncomfortable and chat with their owners when they feel bored. Owners can also teach pets many skills, such as fetching things, and performing tricks.

Onyx eventually became tired of all of the fame surrounding his speaking ability. He decided that it was time he found an owner to love him like all of the owners he had been talking with. He settled down with a nice woman from a small town who did not know that he could talk, and he liked the quiet nature of the place and decided to stay.
